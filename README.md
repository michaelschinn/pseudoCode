To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

1. Pick a topic to pseudocode from the following list
    - Brewing a cup of coffee or tea
    - Driving a remote control car
    - Cooking your favorite meal (can't be PB&J)
    - Downloading an app
    - Washing your hands
    - Being an elevator operator in the 1950s

2. Write your pseudocode in the .md (markdown) file using pseudo code standard language
3. As you complete your project, read it to yourself out loud to make sure the instructions make sense. Consider giving your pseudocode file to someone you know like a friend or family member to see if they get stuck at some point with your instructions so that you can add another step or some clarifying text, or remove parts that don't make sense. Remember, pseudocode should be detailed enough to get the job done without any clarifying questions, but basic enough for anyone to understand.
